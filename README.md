### Overview
#### The project is focused on how climate can affect crop economics in countries that have the highest cocoa production through effects such as abiotic damage (drought, flooding), disease (pathogens and pests), and varying temperature. Crop production statistics have a direct impact on local economies to different extents. Comparing and contrasting the data between these areas could provide insight on how best to mitigate financial strain on those that produce crops as well as their respective economies.

### Questions to answer include:
#### 1. Varying climate in these countries – What is the correlation between the adoption of farmers’ financial climate change adaptation strategies by region (and crop production/failure rates?)
#### 2. Varying production in these countries (prices, volume, quality, condition, and other market data) – compare and contrast, gather correlation data
#### 3. What is the impact of climate-induced supply shock to cocoa production in top cocoa-producing countries (Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, Côte D’Ivoire) on capital balance, GDP, agricultural investment, and food instability?
#### 4. How climate impacts production and local economics as a result (as well as the degree of correlation between datasets) – All three of us
